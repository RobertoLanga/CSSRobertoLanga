      <h3>Aspiring Web Developer</h3>
      <p class="web-dev-description">Learning how to speak HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript at the moment. Really into Front End as it soothes my OCD senses and need for having things perfectly aligned while also adressing my creative side with the visual aspect of it all, but I'm looking forward to exploring the depths of Back End as well.</p>

    <h2>Means of establishing contact</h2>
    <h3>In the mornings I can usually be found jogging in the parks of Bucharest. Evenings in the kitchen, most likely checking the oven after forgeting about it for a while.</h3>
    <p>Mail delivered by ravens or owls accepted as well. This method is actually the most endorsed one. The letter that I was suposed to receive by owl when I was 11 years old never arrived so I'm looking forward to experiencing this.</p>
